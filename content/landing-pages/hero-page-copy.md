## Questions? We've Got Answers.

**Q: Do my supporters need cryptocurrency?**
No. They can buy crypto instantly with a credit card through our integrated on-ramp, or use Google/Apple login to create a wallet in 30 seconds.

**Q: What fees does TipChain charge?**
Zero platform fees. Gas fees are sponsored. If you convert crypto to fiat, there's a 0.5-1% exchange fee—but you can keep tips in crypto for 0% total fees.

**Q: How quickly do I receive tips?**
Instantly. Tips appear in your wallet within 10-60 seconds after confirmation on the blockchain.

Absolutely. Many creators use multi-platform strategies. TipChain handles one-time tips; other platforms can manage memberships.

Yes. We use industry-standard security (MPC wallets, encrypted storage). You maintain custody of your funds—they're never held by TipChain.
